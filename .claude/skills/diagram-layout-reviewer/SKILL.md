# Diagram Layout Reviewer

A post-processing pass that accepts a draw.io XML file plus a content spec and produces clean, presentation-ready XML with corrected layout and styling.

## When to invoke

Invoke this **after** the diagram's content (nodes, labels, relationships) is finalized but **before** saving the final diagram. It is a layout QA gate — it does not invent content, only fixes how existing content is laid out.

---

## Inputs

| Input | Description |
|---|---|
| `diagram_xml` | Raw draw.io XML string (mxGraphModel format) |
| `content_spec` | Markdown list describing the expected nodes, columns, and flow |
| `canvas_size` | Target dimensions, e.g. `"1400x900"` (landscape) |
| `audience` | `"management"` \| `"technical"` — controls label verbosity |

---

## What the pass checks and fixes

### 1. Canvas & page size
- Set `pageWidth` / `pageHeight` to match `canvas_size`.
- Portrait (e.g. 900×1050) → rotate to landscape (e.g. 1400×900) automatically.

### 2. Z-order: container labels must render above arrows
- A text label inside a container (e.g. a service-boundary box title) must be defined **after all arrows** in the XML. draw.io renders elements in document order — later = higher z.
- Labels defined before arrows get covered by arrow lines passing through the same area.
- Always add `fillColor=<container_background_color>` to container labels so they have a solid backing that covers any arrow line that still passes through, even if z-order is imperfect.
- **Check:** scan the XML for any `text;` style node inside a container rect that is defined before `edge="1"` elements. If found, move it after all edges.

### 3. Arrow routing — intermediate annotation boxes
- When an annotation badge is placed inside a container, its x-range becomes a blocked zone for arrows routing from inside the container to an outer column.
- For any arrow that exits a node's right edge (`exitX=1`) and targets an outer column, check whether the horizontal-then-vertical path drawn by `orthogonalEdgeStyle` passes through the badge's bounding box.
- The default `orthogonalEdgeStyle` bend point is typically at `x_mid = (source_right + target_left) / 2`. If that `x_mid` falls within the badge's x-range AND the vertical segment's y-range overlaps the badge's y-range, the arrow clips the badge.
- **Fix:** add explicit `Array` waypoints to force the vertical segment to `x > badge_right_edge` (a safe value is `container_right_edge - 2`).

### 4. Arrow routing — fan-out from a node
- Detect nodes whose multiple outgoing arrows all share the same `exitX/exitY`.
- Redistribute exit points across the node height:
  - 2 targets: `exitY=0.25`, `0.75`
  - 3 targets: `exitY=0.2`, `0.5`, `0.8`
  - 4 targets: `exitY=0.15`, `0.38`, `0.62`, `0.88`
- **Rule:** each outgoing arrow exits at a unique Y point. No two arrows share the same `exitY` on the same source node.

### 5. Arrow routing — response / return arrow
- A return arrow from the last step back to the caller must **never** pass through a content box.
- **Correct pattern for a multi-column layout:** exit the last step's **bottom-center**, route DOWN to a clearance Y below the container bottom, then LEFT to the target box X, then UP into the target box **top-center**.
  ```
  exitX=0.5, exitY=1 on last step
  <mxPoint x="{step_center_x}" y="{container_bottom + 40}" />
  <mxPoint x="{target_center_x}" y="{container_bottom + 40}" />
  entryX=0.5, entryY=0 on target box
  ```
- **Anti-pattern:** routing via a waypoint *below* the target box forces draw.io to backtrack, creating overlapping lines that obscure the box text.
- The vertical segment of this route must NOT pass through any annotation badge inside the container — keep its x position outside the x-range of any interior annotation nodes.

### 6. Annotation badge placement
- Badges that annotate a step must **not** sit in the horizontal arrow band between the step's right edge and an outer column.
- Correct placement: inside the container, below the last step, at an x that does not intersect the response arrow's vertical path. A safe zone is `x = {container_right_edge - badge_width - 10}` (right-aligned inside the container).
- Apply `dashed=1;dashPattern=6 3` to visually distinguish annotation badges from regular nodes.

### 7. Container boundaries
- Verify each node the spec places inside a container is actually positioned within the container rectangle (x/y within bounds).
- Flag nodes that the spec places *outside* a container but that landed inside it, and move them out.
- **Legend overflow check:** compute the bottom of the last legend item (`y + height`). The legend background box must extend at least ~14px below it; if not, increase its height: `h = (last_item_bottom - legend_bg_top) + 14`.

### 8. Content completeness (against the spec)
- Cross-check the XML against `content_spec`: every node and edge named in the spec must be present in the diagram, in the column/region the spec assigns it.
- Missing any spec'd node/edge → add it before writing the output XML.
- Do NOT invent nodes that aren't in the spec — completeness is measured against the spec, not against the reviewer's assumptions.

### 9. Label accuracy
- Expand ambiguous labels so they name the actual component or boundary the spec intends (e.g. a label that says only "APIs" should name the specific integration or security layer the spec describes).
- This matters when a label hides a meaningful boundary (a security/trust layer, an integration tier) behind a generic word.

### 10. Label simplification (management audience)
- Strip class names, method signatures, query fragments, and file paths from labels.
- Keep: plain-English description, icon, step number.
- Move technical detail into the `tooltip` attribute.

### 11. Colour consistency
Apply one palette consistently. Example (adapt to the spec's layers):

| Layer | Fill | Stroke |
|---|---|---|
| Client / user | `#dae8fc` | `#6c8ebf` |
| Cloud infrastructure | `#ffe6cc` | `#d79b00` |
| AI model & external tools | `#e1d5e7` | `#9673a6` |
| Service/task boundary | `#f0f4ff` | `#4a6fa5` (strokeWidth=2) |
| Success / answer | `#d5e8d4` | `#82b366` |
| Annotation badges | `#fff0f0` | `#cc0000` (dashed) |

### 12. Text contrast on any canvas theme (dark-mode safety)
Scan every text-bearing cell. **Black text (`fontColor=#000000`) is only readable on a light fill
you control — never on the canvas background.** A bare `text;` element (title, standalone label)
with no `fillColor` renders black-on-dark and is **invisible when the viewer opens the file in dark
theme**. Fix: give every `text;`/title/label a light `fillColor` (e.g. `fillColor=#eef2f7;strokeColor=none;`).
Edge labels are safe only if they carry `labelBackgroundColor=#ffffff`. Flag any cell with visible
`value=` text whose style has `fillColor=none` or no `fillColor` at all.

### 13. No edge crosses a node box (generalises §3)
§3 only guards annotation badges; the real rule is broader: **no edge segment may pass through the
bounding box of ANY node it does not connect.** Build the orthogonal path for each edge (from
exit point, through waypoints, to entry point) and test every segment against every node rectangle
(excluding the edge's own source/target). If a segment clips a box, **add `Array` waypoints to
route the edge around it** — through the nearest gap between nodes, or out to a margin gutter (top
above the spine, bottom below it, or a side column). A short detour that stays in whitespace beats
a straight line through a box every time. Also verify no edge's **label** lands on top of a node
box or another edge's label — nudge the label (offset in the edge geometry) or reroute so the
longest segment (where the label sits) is in clear space.

### 14. Node spacing & no overlaps
- **No two node rectangles may touch or overlap.** Compute every pair's bounding boxes; if they
  intersect (or sit < ~20px apart), move one and, if needed, widen `pageWidth`/`pageHeight`. The
  canvas is free; crowding is not.
- **Target the gaps that read as cramped:** ≥ ~70px between adjacent boxes on a horizontal spine,
  ≥ ~60px between stacked rows/bands. Text-dense boxes need more, not less.
- A node placed to annotate/scale/feed exactly one other node should sit **directly above or below
  its partner** so the connector is a short straight line — flag satellites parked diagonally
  across the diagram and move them under their partner.

```

Steps the pass runs:
1. Read the draw.io XML.
2. Run all checks above (§1–§11).
3. Write corrected XML back to the file.
4. Report a summary of changes made.
