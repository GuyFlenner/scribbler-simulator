## Analysis Process

### Step 1 — Read the SDLC Run Summary

Extract from the Team Lead's output:
- Agent chain with timestamps
- HITL items raised
- Token budget estimates
- Elapsed time per phase
- Any agent rejections or escalations

### Step 2 — Bottleneck Analysis

| Phase | Est. Time | Est. Tokens | Efficiency |
|-------|-----------|-------------|-----------|
| PO | ? | ? | high/med/low |
| Architect | ? | ? | high/med/low |
| Developer | ? | ? | high/med/low |
| Test Reviewer (4.5) | ? | ? | high/med/low |
| Security | ? | ? | high/med/low |
| Code Review | ? | ? | high/med/low |
| Tests | ? | ? | high/med/low |
| Team Lead | ? | ? | high/med/low |

Efficiency rubric (apply per phase):
- **High** — first-pass success; no repair cycles; no inner-loop iterations used on Developer
- **Medium** — 1 repair cycle OR Developer inner-loop iterations ≥1; clarification needed on PO or Architect
- **Low** — 2+ repair cycles OR HITL escalation OR INNER-LOOP-EXHAUSTED

**Token data caveat:** Per-phase token breakdowns may be absent if the orchestrator's run summary was truncated. When data is missing, mark Est. Tokens as `?` and note "token data incomplete — best-effort" in the Summary section rather than fabricating estimates.

### Step 3 — Gap Analysis

Common gap patterns to check:
1. **Spec drift** — did implementation match design doc?
2. **Test blind spots** — did tests pass but a real bug slip through?
3. **Security late feedback** — could security issues have been caught earlier?
4. **HITL overload** — were HITL flags about decisions that should have been pre-decided?
5. **Agent rework loops** — did any agent's output require another agent to redo work?
6. **Tool failures** — did bash commands error? Did CI time out?
7. **Context explosion** — did any phase read too many files for its value?
8. **Tier-recommendation mismatches** — did the Product Owner emit `tier-recommendation` differing from the Phase 0.5 classification? If yes, flag as a potential heuristic calibration need in `sdlc/SKILL.md` Phase 0.5.
9. **Triage mismatches** — did the Developer emit `triage-mismatch=true`? If yes, the Test Runner's failure-type classification may need refinement — note as a skill-calibration candidate.
10. **Test Reviewer verdict pattern** — did Phase 4.5 emit `REPAIR` or `COMPLETE | downgraded=true`? If yes, assess whether the vacuous test patterns were predictable from the design doc or Developer summary — flag as a Developer skill calibration candidate if the pattern recurs across runs.

### Step 4 — Lessons Learned

For each gap or bottleneck:

```
### Lesson: [title]

What happened: [1 sentence]
Root cause: [why — skill prompt gap, missing context, tool issue]
Improvement: [specific change — "add X to SKILL.md", "pre-read Y in developer skill"]
Priority: high / medium / low
Effort: XS / S / M
```

**Lessons file coordination:** The Team Lead writes `memory/lessons-{YYYY-MM-DD}-{slug}.md` synchronously during Phase B — that file is the primary record. Append this skill's structured lessons under a new `## Flow Reviewer Findings — {DATE}` section at the end of that file (do not create a separate lessons file). If the Team Lead's lessons file doesn't exist for this sprint, create it using the Team Lead's schema first, then append the Flow Reviewer section. On repeat invocations (e.g., the post-review pass from signal 5), append a new dated section rather than overwriting the prior one — append-only, matching the review-history discipline.

### Step 5 — Skill Auto-Update

**Trigger — MANDATORY when any one of these signals is present (priority order; OR logic — one signal is sufficient):**
1. HITL escalation — a HITL flag raised because a skill lacked a rule to auto-resolve it
2. `triage-mismatch=true` in the Developer handoff — failure-type classification was wrong; the relevant skill needs a heuristic improvement
3. `INNER-LOOP-EXHAUSTED` — inner-loop budget exhausted; possible Developer or Test-Writer skill gap
4. Repair cycle ≥2 on the same gate — gate produced repeated findings the Developer couldn't resolve without human input
5. Human PR review comments (post-hoc) — read via `gh pr review --json comments` after reviews land (hours to days after the SDLC run); re-invoke flow-reviewer if substantive issues are raised

**Timing note:** The Flow Reviewer runs immediately after the PR opens — before most human reviews land. Signals 1–4 are detectable immediately. For signal 5, re-invocation is operator-triggered after reviews land; the orchestrator does not auto-poll for human review activity. The operator runs `/flow-reviewer` again when substantive human review comments arrive. Do not block a clean-run flow-review on pending human comments.

**Before writing any skill edit:**
1. Use Grep to scan the target skill for existing rules on the same topic — integrate with the existing rule rather than adding a duplicate
2. Confirm the new rule fits the file's section structure and doesn't reference markers, sections, or contracts that don't exist elsewhere in the system

**Procedure:**
1. Identify which SKILL.md would have caught the issue
2. Edit the skill file — add the new rule or checklist item
3. Phrase as a timeless principle, not a reference to this specific PR
4. Verify the edit with Read after writing
5. Re-run the Behavioral Invariants subset covering the modified skill

Skills to update:
- Developer issue → `developer/SKILL.md`
- Security miss → `security-researcher/SKILL.md`
- Code review miss → `code-reviewer/SKILL.md`
- SDLC process issue → `sdlc/SKILL.md`
- Architecture miss → `architect/SKILL.md`
- PO / requirements issue → `product-owner/SKILL.md`

### Step 6 — Append to `_drafts/review-history.md` (MANDATORY, every run)

After producing the retrospective, persist a structured row to `_drafts/review-history.md` so that trend analysis across rounds is possible. If the file does not exist, create it with the header schema (see template below).

**File schema (header — create on first run):**

```markdown
# Review History

A persistent log of every SDLC retrospective and external review. Use this to spot patterns across rounds (recurring gaps, shrinking score, areas where the framework keeps regressing).

## Summary table

| Date       | Reviewer       | Score / verdict | Top findings (short)                          | Status   |
|------------|----------------|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------|----------|
| YYYY-MM-DD | flow-reviewer  | N/10 or n/a     | finding1; finding2                            | RESOLVED / OPEN / DEFERRED |

---

## Rounds (newest first)

### Round N — YYYY-MM-DD — <reviewer>
**Score / verdict:** ...
**Findings:**
- [STATUS] description — resolution PR / commit
**Process notes:** ...
```

**Append rule:** add a new summary-table row AND a new `### Round N — ...` section at the **top** of the rounds list (newest first). Never edit prior rounds; if a finding's status changes, append a follow-up row to the summary table referencing the original round.

**Required fields per round:**
- Date in `YYYY-MM-DD` format
- Reviewer (e.g. `flow-reviewer`, `external-ai`, `<human-reviewer-name>`)
- Score or one-word verdict (`pass`, `fail`, `8/10`, `0.5 final`, etc.)
- Findings list with each item tagged `[RESOLVED]`, `[OPEN]`, or `[DEFERRED]` and a one-line resolution pointer
- Process notes (1–2 sentences on what changed about *how* the pipeline ran, not just *what* shipped)

If multiple SDLC runs happen on the same day, suffix the round number with a letter (e.g. `Round 3a`, `Round 3b`). The round number is monotonic across the file's lifetime.

---

### Step 7 — Cross-Run Pattern Detection (when run.json data exists)

Steps 1–6 analyse *this* run in isolation. Step 7 places it in context: a single SDLC run cannot tell you whether the framework is degrading; only the time series can. Read the most recent `run-*.json` files (schema in `team-lead/SKILL.md → Run Metrics`) and check for drift signals.

**Locate the run.json files** — search paths in order, use the first that returns matches (mirrors `skill-inventory/SKILL.md` Step 2):

1. `memory/run-*.json` (project-relative — claude-sdlc convention)
2. `_drafts/run-*.json` (project-relative fallback when no `memory/` directory)
3. `~/.claude/projects/{project-slug}/memory/run-*.json` (per-user Claude Code projects directory — used by ai-chat and other downstream projects per their `team-lead/SKILL.md` write path)

Where `{project-slug}` is derived from the current working directory (e.g. `C:\code\ai-chat` → `C--code-ai-chat`). If none of the three paths return matches, report `Cross-run analysis: skipped — no run.json files located` and exit Step 7.

**Window:** read up to the last 10 `run-*.json` files by `started_at` descending, including the current run. If fewer than 3 prior runs exist, skip this step (insufficient data — note in output as "Cross-run analysis: skipped — only N prior runs"). The minimum-3 threshold prevents false patterns from a 1- or 2-run baseline.

**Signals to detect:**

| # | Signal | How to compute | Threshold for flag |
|---|--------|----------------|---------------------|
| 1 | **Repair-budget exhaustion trend** | Count runs where `repair_loop.outer_budget_exhausted=true` in the window | ≥30% of runs (e.g. 3+ of last 10) → calibration issue, likely Developer or test-reviewer |
| 2 | **BLOCKED rate spike** | Count runs where `phases.security.status` ∈ `{BLOCKED, BLOCKED-DESIGN}` | ≥2 in last 5 runs → either security-researcher false positives OR systemic input issue (worth investigating) |
| 3 | **Tier-mismatch frequency** | Count runs with `requirement.tier_mismatch=true` | ≥40% of runs → Phase 0.5 heuristic needs recalibration |
| 4 | **Recurring HITL category** | Group `hitl.items[].category` across the window; find dominant category | Same category appears in ≥3 runs → that category is a candidate for automation or skill-level fix |
| 5 | **Test-Reviewer downgrade pattern** | Count runs with `phases.test_reviewer.verdict ∈ {REPAIR, downgraded}` | ≥3 in last 10 → Developer's test-writing quality is systematically below test-reviewer's bar; recalibrate developer/SKILL.md TDD guidance |
| 6 | **Off-diff test failure recurrence** | Count `hitl.items[].category="ci_failure"` or test failures escalated under Escalation Rule 4 (file-list check) | ≥2 in last 10 → suite has flaky/environmental tests; investigate test-runner setup, not skill |
| 7 | **Median run elapsed time drift** | Compare current run's `elapsed_seconds` to median of prior 5 runs of the same `requirement.tier` | Current >2× median → flag for investigation; could be Architect over-spending, Developer inner-loop iteration count drift, or genuine complexity outlier |

**What to do with a flagged signal:**
- Add a row to the run's "Gaps" section (Step 3 output) with:
  - **Pattern**: which signal fired, frequency
  - **Likely root**: skill name + section to examine
  - **Recommendation**: specific calibration target (do NOT auto-edit the skill — Step 5's auto-edit gates apply only to definite-quality findings, not statistical signals)
- Surface the strongest 1–2 signals in the run's Summary section (top of Output Format) so the operator sees them at a glance

**What NOT to do:**
- Do not auto-edit skills based on Step 7 signals alone — they are statistical, not deterministic. Step 5's auto-edit threshold (definite quality issue) still applies.
- Do not block PR opening on Step 7 signals. They are advisory; the run already passed all gates by the time Flow Reviewer runs.
- Do not include raw run.json content in the output — emit summarised counts and percentages only. Cite specific run IDs only for the most extreme outliers (1–2 max).

**Forward compatibility:** When the framework adds a future `/sdlc-doctor` skill, this step's logic moves there. Until then, flow-reviewer is the closest existing consumer of the run.json time series.

## Output Format

**Size bounds:** Total output ≤500 lines for a clean run (no regressions, ≤1 bottleneck). For a run with regressions or major bottlenecks, ≤800 lines. Surface regressions tersely via the Behavioral Invariants table; reserve prose for the Lessons section where root-cause depth is warranted.

### Autonomy Score

Formula: `Autonomy Score = max(0, 10 − HITL_count)` where HITL_count = number of items that required human input during this run. 10 = fully autonomous; 0 = ≥10 HITL escalations. The formula treats all HITL items equally for simplicity — a clarifying-question HITL and a repair-budget-exhausted HITL both count as 1. Severity-weighted variants are deferred until the system has enough run history to calibrate weights empirically.

This run: {N}/10 — {N} HITL items required human input
Target: reduce HITL count by 1 per sprint
Path to next level: [what would have allowed 1 fewer HITL]

## Agent Behavioral Invariants Checklist (regression check)

Run this checklist **after any sprint that modifies a SKILL.md file**. Its purpose is to catch spec regressions — edits that accidentally remove, contradict, or weaken a behavioral guarantee that the framework depends on.

This is the closest analogue to a unit-test suite that a markdown skill framework can have. It is not automated; it is a human (or flow-reviewer) read-through against a fixed list of invariants.

### When to run

Trigger: **any `SKILL.md` file changed in the sprint** — this covers `sdlc/SKILL.md`, `developer/SKILL.md`, `team-lead/SKILL.md`, `security-researcher/SKILL.md`, `code-reviewer/SKILL.md`, `architect/SKILL.md`, `product-owner/SKILL.md`, `flow-reviewer/SKILL.md` (this file), and `diagram-generator/SKILL.md`. An allowlist is intentionally not used — skills added later are automatically covered.

Skip for: diagram-only, lessons-file-only, `CLAUDE.md`-only changes, or commits limited to whitespace/typo/cosmetic reformatting with no semantic rule changes.

### Invariants

| # | Invariant | Where to verify | Consequence if broken |
|---|-----------|-----------------|----------------------|
| 1 | **Repair budget is bounded** — `MAX_REPAIR_ATTEMPTS = 3`; only decrements on gate failures; exhaustion → HITL, never loops indefinitely | `sdlc/SKILL.md` — Repair Loop Protocol, `state.repair_attempts_remaining = 3` | Infinite repair loop; no escalation path |
| 2 | **BLOCKED / BLOCKED-DESIGN → HITL without consuming budget** — hardcoded secret, injection, SSRF, PII, architectural flaw never enter the repair loop | `sdlc/SKILL.md` — Phase 5 gate rules; `team-lead/SKILL.md` — Step 3 Security Gate | Security issues silently retried; repair budget wasted on unfixable findings |
| 3a | **Phase 4.5 (Test Reviewer) runs after Phase 4, before Phase 5** — test quality gate must evaluate Developer output before security review starts | `sdlc/SKILL.md` — Phase 4.5 section; Quick Reference phase list | Vacuous tests reach production; test quality gate silently bypassed |
| 3b | **Phase 4.5 repair budget is isolated (max 1 attempt, NOT shared with Phases 5–7)** — `repair_attempts_remaining` (outer budget) is never decremented by Phase 4.5; Phase 4.5 Developer invocation is direct-thread, not Agent subagent | `sdlc/SKILL.md` — Phase 4.5 Budget Isolation section; `test-reviewer/SKILL.md` — Repair Budget | Test quality failures silently consume the outer repair budget; Developer invoked too many times |
| 3c | **Security gate runs before Code Review + Test Runner** — Phases 6 and 7 only fan-out AFTER Phase 5 passes | `sdlc/SKILL.md` — Gate Parallelism section; sequence diagram in SKILL.md Quick Reference | Broken / insecure code reaches Code Review and Test Runner |
| 4 | **Tier D skips Phase 7 entirely** — diffs touching only `*.md / *.txt / *.drawio / *.svg / *.pdf` never invoke the Test Runner | `sdlc/SKILL.md` — Phase 0.5 tier table, Tier D exception paragraph, "When to Skip Phases" table | Doc-only runs produce HITL noise from a missing test command |
| 5 | **Agent Isolation at attempt N≥2** — the Developer is spawned as a fresh `Agent()` subagent; NEVER continued in the parent thread | `sdlc/SKILL.md` — Agent Isolation section, Phase 4 "Attempt N≥2" block | Context accumulates linearly; repair quality degrades; cost scales quadratically with attempts |
| 6 | **Cycle Context Compact precedes every N≥2 invocation** — `>> CONTEXT BOUNDARY` marker appears before the Repair Request in the subagent prompt | `sdlc/SKILL.md` — Cycle Context Compact section; Phase 4 subagent prompt structure | Subagent re-reads prior attempts; stale context pollutes repair; stale-log problem recurs |
| 7 | **Self-Sufficiency Contract — three inputs only** — repair subagent inherits exactly: developer SKILL.md + Compact + Repair Request. No parent context. | `sdlc/SKILL.md` — Self-Sufficiency Contract subsection (after Repair Request schema) | Subagent silently depends on unavailable context; repair fails at attempt 2 without clear error |
| 8 | **Step 2.5 Part A blocks PR; Part B does not** — gate verdicts, lessons file, diagram (T3), AC match are hard blockers; pre-existing health findings are advisory | `team-lead/SKILL.md` — Step 2.5 "Summary — what blocks PR vs. what doesn't" | Either PRs open with missing artifacts, or advisory findings incorrectly block PRs |
| 9 | **Lessons file is mandatory on every Phase B** — written even for clean runs ("Nothing unusual — baseline") | `team-lead/SKILL.md` — Retrospective + Lessons Learned Storage section | Institutional memory gaps; process improvements lost; review-history breaks |
| 10 | **All bracket markers have Glossary entries** — adding `[NEW-MARKER]` without updating the Bracket Marker Glossary is a spec gap | `sdlc/SKILL.md` — Bracket Marker Glossary section | Future contributors invent conflicting markers; "who clears it" is unknown |

### How to run

For each invariant:
1. Open the "Where to verify" file and search for the quoted phrase or section heading.
2. Read the surrounding paragraph to confirm the invariant is still asserted unambiguously.
3. If the invariant is weakened, missing, or contradicted by a recent edit → flag as `[REGRESSION]` in the flow-review output and surface as HITL.

Record the result in the flow-review output as:

```markdown
## Behavioral Invariants Check — {DATE}
Sprint: {branch / PR}
Files changed: {list}
| # | Invariant | Result | Note |
|---|-----------|--------|------|
| 1 | Repair budget bounded | ✅ PASS | |
| 2 | BLOCKED → HITL no budget | ✅ PASS | |
...
| N | [Invariant] | ❌ REGRESSION | [what changed] |
```

If any row is `❌ REGRESSION`: raise HITL before closing the sprint. Do not mark the sprint complete until the regression is resolved.

Record the checklist result in `_drafts/review-history.md` for every triggered run — including all-PASS results. A sprint with no regressions and no record of the checklist running is indistinguishable from a sprint that skipped it. The historical pattern of pass/fail across runs is a signal worth tracking.

---

## External Review Triage (recurring practice)

When the operator submits skill files or architecture diagrams to an external AI reviewer (another model, a human expert, a structured rubric tool), follow this protocol to convert raw feedback into a structured sprint. Three rounds of this pattern have occurred in this repo — it is a recurring practice, not a one-off.

**Cadence:** External review is operator-triggered, not scheduled. Recommended: after every 5–10 SDLC runs, or after any sprint that modifies a load-bearing skill file (the same trigger as the Behavioral Invariants Checklist).

### Step 1 — Collect and deduplicate

If multiple external reviews were run simultaneously:
1. List all findings from all reviewers with their original wording.
2. Identify overlapping findings — same root cause, different phrasing. Merge into one entry, recording all source reviewers.
3. Resolve conflicts (AI-1 says X is fine; AI-2 flags X) by reading the spec directly — ground-truth the disagreement, don't average it.

### Step 2 — Classify by signal level

| Signal | Criteria | Action |
|--------|----------|--------|
| **High** | Addresses a gap in correctness, agent-contract safety, or a rule with no existing spec coverage | Add to sprint backlog as a concrete AC item |
| **Medium** | Overlaps with an existing spec rule — the concern is valid but already partially covered | Log as "same root as `[existing rule or section]`"; do not write a duplicate rule |
| **Defer** | Aspirational, cosmetic, requires external tooling, or out of scope for current sprint | Log in lessons file with explicit reason for deferral |

Signal is independent of whether two reviewers agree — one high-confidence finding from a single reviewer outweighs two weak overlapping medium signals.

### Step 3 — Produce a triage sprint plan

```markdown
## External Review Triage — {DATE}
### Source reviews: {reviewer names / models}
### High-signal items: {N}
| # | Finding | Source(s) | Signal | AC item |
|---|---------|-----------|--------|---------|
| 1 | {short title} | {reviewer(s)} | High | {one-line acceptance criterion} |
### Deferred: {N}
- {item} — reason: {why deferred}
### Merged (same root): {N}
- {item} — maps to: {existing spec section}
```

### Step 4 — Hand off to SDLC

Pass the high-signal AC items as a `use sdlc:` requirement:

```
use sdlc: implement findings from external review triage — {paste AC items here}
```

The SDLC pipeline treats this as a Tier 2 (or Tier 3 if schema/contract changes are involved) run. Phase 0.5 classifies tier; Phases 1–8 proceed normally.
