# btw-status

Answer: **"What is the current status of the active run?"**

This is a context snapshot, not a task — do not start new work. Just report what is happening right now.

---

## What to check (in order)

1. **Active branch + last 5 commits** — `git log --oneline -5`
2. **Open HITL items** — anything flagged as blocked on a human decision or external dependency
3. **Current SDLC phase** — which phase last completed, which is next (if an SDLC run is active). Phase sequence: 0 Branch → 0.5 Classify → 1 PO → 2 TL → 3 Architect → 4 Developer → **4.5 Test Reviewer** → 5 Security → 6+7 Code Review + Tests (parallel) → 8 TL Gate → 9 Flow Reviewer
4. **Open tasks** — any in-progress or pending tasks from the current session
5. **PR status** — open PRs, review state, any blocking comments (`gh pr list` or `gh pr status`)
6. **Repair loop** — if a repair cycle is active, how many attempts remain

---

## Output format

Keep it short. Use this structure:

```
## Status Snapshot — [branch]

**Phase**: [last completed] -> [next up]
**Branch**: [branch name] — [last commit subject]
**PR**: [#N open / none]

### Done this session
- [bullet list of completed steps]

### Next action
- [single most important next step]

### Repair Loop
- Outer (Phases 5–7): [N of 3 attempts used — or "not active"]
- Phase 4.5 (Test Reviewer): [repair attempted / not attempted / downgraded to WARN]

### Open HITL / Blockers
- [anything that needs a human decision — or "None"]
```

If there is no active SDLC run, just report: branch state, last commit, next action, and any blockers.
